# PokePocket
PokePocket application is based on the Kotlin language, which will call the Pokemon API to display information about all the Pokemon and the Pokemon will style in different colors for each Pokemon's background according to a dominant color chosen by an Pokemon in the particular views. We will also develop further to make Pokemon appear randomly on the map, and related AR functions.
